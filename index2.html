<ol>
	<li>Be patient</li>
	<li>There's probably resource on the internet that solves your error. Your error might be 'stupid' or 'simple' but because you literally know nothing about coding, the easiest stuff feels like a uphill battle.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Needing to read and search for multiple sources as sometimes one person's code does not solve your problem</li>
		<li>You don't know the reason why the person's code works because you're not a CS major. That feeling sucks but I also can't be bothered to learn math/algorithm to understand everything urgh</li>
	</ol>
	<li>But seeing things work out is always the greatest enjoyment (so rewarding!!!). So it's all worth it ;) or at least hopefully.</li>

<section id="Technique">**Technique**
	<p>To me, because I don't really know the math behind everything, coding is just a technique [perhaps of the body], anthropologically speaking. </p>
	<p>It's more like a muscle memory, or a tool, than an actual technology that I master. But it's okay because I do enjoy this at the moment</p>
	<p>And this language is so freaking easy - I have thought that coding is hard all my life, but it freaking isn't. It's more straightforward and easier than any (natural) languages I've tried to learn. There's little to none cultural implications to it; the logic is SO STRAIGHTFORWARD. There is little exceptions too.</p>
	<p>There is a great deal of resources on the internet, so if there's anything you wanna do but don't know how to, simply google 'How to use ***tag/attribute'</p>
	<p>That being said, I'd say that what's hard is understanding the algorithm and building one. But the technique really isn't. So just take the initiative and you'll be surprised at what you're capable of as a non scientist/engineer.</p>

<section id="Improve">**Improve**
	<p>Now, how to improve?? How to stay motivated???</p>
	<p>I honestly don't know, but hopefully this journey is rewarding enough so I'll keep going.</p>
